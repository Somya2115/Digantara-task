#INSIGHTS
1)The data has no missing or null values
2)Total Conjunctions are 67038
3)There are maximum low risk conjuction and minimal medium risk conjuction but no high risk conjuction
4)Average collision risk is 6.96
5)On analyzing and visualizing Conjuctions Timeline for sattelite: STARLINK-3927[+] we found that maximum probability of collision is on date: 2023-08-11 and at time:20:47:06.149
6)On Conjunction Analysis for a specific Satellite Norad_CAT_ID_1 51950 for the span of 5 days we get the insight that maximun conjuction take place on 2023-11-10 and minimum on 2023-11-12
